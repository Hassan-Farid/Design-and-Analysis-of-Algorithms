# Divide and Conquer Algorithms
This section contains the analysis of algorithm based on divide and conquer approach. Divide and conquer is a method that is used with recursively designed algorithms. It breaks a certain problem into sub-problems, each one similar but smaller than the actual one and then breaks each sub-problem into further sub-problems until the problems become solvable. Once, each sub-problem is solved, the results are combined together to provide an output for the overall problem.

## Steps of Divide and Conquer Approach:
There are three steps in the divide and conquer approach i.e.

### Divide:
This part divides the problem into subproblems that are of smaller instances of the same problem.

### Conquer:
This part recusrsively calls for the sub-problems until the problem becomes solvable.

### Combine:
This part combines the solution to the subproblems into one overall solution for the original problem.
