# Design and Analysis of Algorithms
This repository contains many notebooks each of which covers an algorithm along with its detailed analysis. At the moment, the repository contains sections which are as follows:

* Introduction to Algorithm Analysis and Design
* Data Structures 
* Divide and Conquer Algorithms 
* Repetition Based Algorithms
* Writing Efficient Algorithms

### Resources:
For those who need to know the resources that I used to learn these concepts:

* Introduction to Algorithms by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, and Clifford Stein (CLRS)
* Data Structures and Algorithms Specialization by UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN DIEGO | NATIONAL RESEARCH UNIVERSITY HIGHER SCHOOL OF ECONOMICS
* Stackoverflow (Obviosuly)
* Brilliant.org
* Algorithm Design by Jon Kleinberg and Ã‰va Tardos
