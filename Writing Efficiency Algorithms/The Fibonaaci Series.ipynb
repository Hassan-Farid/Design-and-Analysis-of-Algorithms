    "# Fibonacci Numbers:\n",
    "The fibonacci numbers are defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "> F$_n$ = F$_{n - 1}$ + F$_{n - 2}$ for n $\\geq$ 2 where F$_o$ = 0, F$_1$ = 1 \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, fibonacci numbers is a sequence of numbers that is created by the sum of its two previous numbers. It starts with the values 0 and 1 and then continues with the sum formula as indicated. Hence, we have for the sequence of fibonacci numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "> F$_n$ = {0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...}\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Golden Ratio Formula:\n",
    "It turns out that the formula for the fibonacci sequence can be extracted using a simple quadratic equation, stated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "> F$_n$ = F$_{n - 1}$ + F$_{n - 2}$ => x$^n$ = x$^{n - 1}$ + x$^{n - 2}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Dividing both sides by x$^{n - 2}$, we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "> x$^2$ = x + 1 => x$^2$ - x - 1 = 0 \n",
    "\n",
    "When this equation is solved, it gives us two real roots (conjugates of each other), as shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "> $\\Phi$ = (1 + $\\sqrt{5}$)/2 ; $\\Phi'$ = (1 - $\\sqrt{5}$)/2\n",
    "\n",
    "The value $\\Phi$ obtained using this equation was termed as \"The Golden Ratio\", because of the fact that this simple number can be used to create the fibonacci series which itself is a special sequence, which one can use to create shape of any size and adjustment. The golden ratio appears in some patterns in nature, including the spiral arrangement of leaves and other plant parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now using this golden ratio, we found out that the i$^{th}$ fibonacci number can be given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "> F$_i$ = ($\\Phi^i$ - ${\\Phi'^i}$)/$\\sqrt{5}$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also write this as:\n",
    "\n",
    "> F$_i$ = ($\\Phi^i$)/$\\sqrt{5}$ - ${\\Phi'^i}$)/$\\sqrt{5}$\n",
    "\n",
    "or\n",
    "\n",
    "> F$_i$ = $\\lfloor$ ($\\Phi^i$)/$\\sqrt{5}$ + 1/2$\\rfloor$ (since |$\\Phi^i$|/$\\sqrt{5}$ < 1/$\\sqrt{5}$ < 1/2)\n",
    "\n",
    "From the above equation we get a new formula for fibonnaci numbers i.e. the i$^{th}$ fibonacci number is equal to the $\\Phi^i$/$\\sqrt{5}$ rounded to the nearest integer. Thus, we can say about the complexity of fibonaaci numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "> T(n) = O($\\Phi^n$) ; $\\forall$ n $\\geq$ 2\n",
    "\n",

    "### Explanation:\n",
    "In this pseudocode, we make use of the recursion property to compute the n^{th} fibonacci number. We use the property that F$_o$ = 0 and F$_1$ = 1 as the base case and return the sum of F$_{n-1}$ and F$_{n-2}$ fibonacci number on each callback until the base case is satisfied. Now lets try to implement this pseudocode in Python and note its timing.\n",
