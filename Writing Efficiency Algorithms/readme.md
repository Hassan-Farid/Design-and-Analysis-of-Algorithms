# Writing Efficient Algorithms:
This section contains various algorithms whose efficiency we increase step by step using different appraoches. The aim of this section is to show how improve some algorithms time as well as space efficiency. This section is incomplete atm and contains the following notebooks:

### The Fibonacci Series: (Incomplete)
This notebook contains detailed analysis of writing an efficient fibonnaci series algorithm step by step with Python Implementation. It covers the following topics atm:

* Fibonacci Numbers
* The Golden Ratio
* Naive Recursive Fibonacci (pseudocode and explanation)
* Python Implementation of Naive Recursive Fibonacci
* Complexity of Naive Recursive Fibonacci
