    "# Algorithms:\n",
    "The term \"Algorithm\" is named after the Misulim Mathemtician \"Muhammad Musa al-Khawarzmi\". An algorithm is a step by step set of instructions with each step staisfying three particular characteristics. __Example__: A simple example of an algorithm might be adding two numbers, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Characteristics of a Step in an Algorithm:\n",
    "Before we move on to the characteristics, lets view the pseudocode for a simple addition algorithm, which sums two numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.0470588); padding:10px 0;font-family:monospace;\">\n",
    "<font color = \"purple\">AddNums(a,b):</font><br>\n",
    "    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color = \"green\"> c = a + b </font><br>\n",
    "    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color = \"green\"> return c </font>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definite:\n",
    "A step in an algorithm must be precisely defined as to what its purpose is. __Example__: When adding two numbers, the purpose of the step _c = a + b_ is precisely defined i.e. we need to sum the values a and b and store the result computed into a new variable i.e. c\n",
    "\n",
    "### Effectively Computable:\n",
    "A step in an algorithm must be effectively computable by a computer. __Example__: In the provided algorithm, if we provide a particular number for a and b, the computer will be able to sum their results and give a proper result, thus, being effectively computable. On the other hand, if we pass one integer and the other string, then the computer will not be able to compute the result effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Termination:\n",
    "A step in an algorithm must reach termination within some finite amount of time. __Example__: In the provided algorithm, for provided values of a and b, the step _c = a + b_ always reaches completion after a finite amount of time, even though the time range can increase with the size of inputs. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Structure of an Algorithm:\n",
    "Algorithms are simply a set of instructions and can be structured into three parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input of an Algorithm:\n",
    "Input parameters are included in an algorithm in case the algorithm needs to compute the result based on some provided input as in the _AddNums_ example.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pseudocode:\n",
    "Pseudocode is a simple english like based representation of the program or algorithm to be written. The syntax of a pseudocode is simple enough to convert it into a program for any programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output:\n",
    "Output is the intended result(s) to be obtained by the provided algorithm(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sub-Algorithms:\n",
    "Algorithms can also use other algorithms within themselves which return a certain result. These algorithms which return a values instead of terminating with an end output are termed as \"Sub-Algorithms\". The provided example of _AddNums_ can be considered as a Sub-Algorithm. In programming, algorithms are also depicted in the shape of sub-algorithms as methods with some paramteres and return value(s) which are then used using some callback property.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Loop Invariant:\n",
    "Loop Invariant is a part of the pseudocode (in case of iterative/recursive based approaches), which helps us to understand why a particular algorithm is correct. A loop invariant has three properties, which need to be satisfied:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initialization:\n",
    "The algorithm holds true prior to the first iteration of the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Maintainence:\n",
    "If the algorithm holds true before iteration of the loop, it remains true after the next iteration as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Termination:\n",
    "When the loop reaches termination, the invariant provides a useful result which helps us in determining whether the algorithm is right or wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Analysis of Algorithms:\n",
    "Analysis of Algorithms is the theoretical study of computer programs performance and resource usage i.e. it is the study to make efficient algorithms. This analysis takes place on two basic measures i.e.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Time Complexity (Running Time)\n",
    "* Space Complexity (Occupied Space)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Time Complexity:\n",
    "Time Complexity provides us with the time it takes for an algorithm to run properly for the provided input size. It is denoted by T(n) where n represents the size of the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Space Complexity:\n",
    "Space Complexity provides us with the space that an algorithm uses to run properly for the provided input size. It is denoted by S(n) where n represents the size of the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Time-Space Tradeoff:\n",
    "In terms of algorithms, one would want the least time complexity along with the least space complexity but that is not possible on the basis of Time-Space Tradeoff. According to this tradeoff, if the time of an algorithm decreases then the space occupied by that algorithm increases. Moreover, if the space occupied by an algorithm decreases, its time complexity increase. An example of a technique which makes use of this tradeoff is dynamic programming memoization, which decreases the time complexity of an algorithm by increasing the space occupied.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Kinds of Analysis:\n",
    "We can classify the analysis of algorithms into three types based on space and time parameters. Here we mention the various analysis based on time (although the same holds true for space)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Worst Case:\n",
    "T(n) = Maximum running time on any input size n. This means that worst case is that scenario with a particular input that makes the most time out of the provided algorithm. __Example__: For an algorithm that is sorting in ascending order, the descending order array maybe a worst case\n",
    "\n",
    "### Average Case:\n",
    "T(n) = Expected running time over all inputs of size n. This means that average case gives us the approximate average running time that a particular algorithm takes for any kind of input. This is done by assuming some statistical distribution over the provided inputs (usually normal distribution). __Example__: For an algorithm that is sorting in ascending order, a randomly ordered array maybe an average case.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Case:\n",
    "T(n) = Minimum running time on any input of size n. This means that best case is that scenario with a particular input that makes the least time out of the provided algorithm. __Example__: For an algorithm that is sorting in ascending order, the already ascending order array maybe a best case. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Pseudocode Conventions:\n",
